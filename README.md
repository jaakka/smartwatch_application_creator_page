# smartwatch_application_creator_page


Here is the design tool for my smartwatch project's JP code. 
On this page, you can design applications for the Arduino smartwatch project, 
and they will be transferred to the memory card of the watch. In this latest version, 
variables are now also allowed.

You can test it here:
